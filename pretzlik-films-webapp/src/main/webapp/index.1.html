				<h2>Luke Pretzlik</h2>
				<p>
				Luke Pretzlik was born in 1973 in London. <br>
				As a kid he was close to nature.<br>
				He did well at the Lycee Francais Charles de Gaulle and spent a year in Africa after finishing with straight A&acute;s.<br>
				He&acute;s travelled around 40 countries all with a backpack.<br>
				He graduated from Bristol University with a degree in Zoology, bought a camera and went to Brazil to make a film about the Amazon and the Pantanal region.<br>
				He used this as a showreel and on the back of that and a well worded letter, he joined the BBC Natural History Unit where he began making wildlife films.<br>
				</p>

				<p>
				His credits include the twice BAFTA nominated film Operation Lemur featuring John Cleese in Madagascar and Congo, a 3 part series about Central African wildlife both for the BBC.
				</p>

				<p>
				He worked on blue chip programming for some 6 years and then went independent.
				This was mostly to take a break from the hard work schedule that those sort of documentaries demand.
				Working independently he could pick and choose the work and develop his skills as a more complete film maker.
				</p>

				<p>
				More recently he has produced documentaries about mental health some of which were commissioned by Mind, the leading mental health charity.
				Because of his own struggle with manic depression he has huge insight into mania, depression and psychosis.
				A self confessed expert.
				</p>

				<p>
				Before he moved back to London he spent 7 years in Bristol studying and working.
				They were difficult times because it was at 23 that the first breakdown would take place.
				Work, a girl, shut off emotions building up and bang like a pressure cooking exploding the sub conscious emerged into the conscious, firing all sort of strange signals.
				Some of it very dark...
				</p>

				<h2>Thinking about making a film?</h2>
				<p>

			<div class="column-640">
				<h2>Film making is an art form</h2>
				<p>
				like painting and writing.  Some say that photographs capture the soul and if they do then one could say the same of moving images.  Be very careful when you make films because it&acute;s captured for good, until you loose or destroy it.  Take care especially with the finished product which you are going to show to someone else.  What I&acute;m trying to say is don&acute;t just point and shoot endless ly.   If it were celluloid you would be being much more careful.  Shoot as if every frame counts.  Then when there is no action cut it off.
				</p>

			</div>
			<!-- /end column 1 -->

			<div class="clear"></div>


			<div class="column-640">
				<h2>Wedding videos</h2>
				<p>
				are snubbed a little by some film makers, un creative and a quick buck.  And in some ways they are right.   I&acute;m yet to be impressed by a wedding video I&acute;ve seen.  Wouldn&acute;t it be cool to film a wedding video that covered the two weeks before the wedding.  Or that there were such good interviews that it became engaging.   Why not make a really cool wedding video.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="clear"></div>

			<div class="column-240">
				<h2>Camera</h2>
				<p>
				To choose your camera first you need to know what you&acute;re going to film.  For human interest stories you could get away with any camera but for landscapes and wildlife you need good lenses.  If you&acute;re filming a wedding then any camera that you find in a high street retailer would do.   Most of them are now high definition.  The quality is very good.
				</p>
				<p>
				That said you may want to look the part and go for something with a few more options.   For that you&acute;ll have to do your own research.   I use the Sony Z1 which is fabulous.  It&acute;s a bit dated now but still works fine.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="column-240">
				<h2>Framing</h2>
				<p>
				Framing a shot comes with practice.  This is the most important thing you will learn when filming.  A well framed shot should be rich in information and balanced.  For the most part it should be easy on the eye.  Framing a moving shot can take practice too and managing the focus and zoom at the same time can be troublesome.    That said wildlife cameramen are particularly good at it so you could learn too.  It&acute;s called pulling focus.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="column-240">
				<h2>Tripod</h2>
				<p>
				If  you&acute;re going to bother buying a camera then you should buy a tripod  The heavier tripods are better because they are more stable.  But if you&acute;re not fussed then you could pick one up for no money.  You might need a tripod if you&acute;re thinking of doing video diary footage.  If you&acute;re thinking of documenting a particular time in your life through video diary footage then know rthar ir can really healing to do that.  You could do it with our iphone or your stills camera.  Turn the camera back on you and record something once or twice a day.   We don&acute;t talk enough about important things and that&acute;s why people go and see a shrink.  Seeing a shrink is expensive and carries it&acute;s own stigma so talk to yourself a little.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="column-240">
				<h2>Sound</h2>
				<p>
				If you&acute;re taking you rself half seriously as a documentary film maker then you should have external sound recording.  The inbuilt mics in these cameras just aren&acute;t that good, besides they pick up noise.  You may want to consider a radio mic set too.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="clear"></div>


			<div class="column-240">
				<h2>Batteries</h2>
				<p>
				Always buy your camera with a spare battery.  You can use one while the other is charging and then swap them over.
				</p>
			</div>


			<div class="column-240">
				<h2>Lighting</h2>
				<p>
				In most cases you wont need dedicated lights to light a scene.  Moving a lamp closer to the subject or opening shutter to let more light in could re-address the light balance. Try not to overexpose the subject.  In high light conditions this may mean reducing the aperture or playing with the gain.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="column-240">
				<h2>Subject</h2>
				<p>
				Apart from framing a shot correctly it&acute;s important that you choose the subject of your film correctly.   Is it interesting enough to carry a whole film?  Is there anything else that you would like to include?  When choosing your subject it&acute;s an idea to know who your audience is.  Will it interest your audience?
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="column-240">
				<h2>Shot sizes</h2>
				<p>
				One of the biggest mistakes amateur film makers make is not to get enough close ups.  When filming a subject get the wide shot first and then zoom in to take a close up.  You&acute;ll find this useful when you come to cutting.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="clear"></div>


			<div class="column-240">
				<h2>Shot length</h2>
				<p>
				You should hold each shot for at around 6  seconds.  If there is lots of action in the image then hold it longer.  This gives the human eye enough time to absorb the image and then to move on to the next one before it gets bored.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="column-240">
				<h2>Storytelling</h2>
				<p>
				It&acute;s essential in any film that isn&acute;t just rough footage to have a story.  That means a beginning, middle and an end.   This can be pre-planned a lot of the time by writing a script, making a mental note of where you would like the film to go or can be sorted out in post production (editing basically).  It&acute;s important in documentary film making to keep an open mind because you may come across something which changes the direction of your film and you should be prepared to absorb it.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="column-240">
				<h2>Editing</h2>
				<p>
				Editing is a way of ordering your shots and removing all the waste footage.   Without it your film may seem laborious.  The more you&acute;ve shot the more difficult the edit so be conservative when you shoot.  Editing is the point where you can import other footage and lay down music.  If your project is involved the advise would be to choose somebody to do the editing who is not involved in the production of the film because they have fresh eyes.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="column-240">
				<h2>Finding a broadcaster</h2>
				<p>
				If you&acute;re looking to broadcast your film it&acute;s advisable to shoot a trailer first and send that  in to the channel.  It&acute;s more than likely that if you send the full version in they will want to make changes.  It is also advisable to go through an established production company as they generally have a good relationship with the commissioners and add weight to your application if they support you.
